breathing-tcn
==============================

Prototype of passing Breathing data to Temporal Convolutional Neural Networks

There's a notebook with the process for preparing the data, one for training a Classifier model on Well/Unwell, and one  for a Regressor model to predict number of breaths.

I included two different environments in the `envs` folder, one for preparing the data and one for training the models.  I find Tensorflow can be fussy and tends to work best in a fairly minimal environment, where there's less risk that one of its dependencies has been modified by another package.

To use the Data Prep notebook, go to the envs folder and create its environment with this command: conda env create -f resp_cleaning.yml

To use the TCN notebooks, go to the envs folder and create its environment with this command: conda env create -f tf_environment.yml

Project assumes you have the Breathing data downloaded into the `data/raw` folder and unzipped.
